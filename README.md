###Palindrome Finder


Write a function that takes any number of words or sentences and outputs the reverse of the words or the sentences, 
and, if the word or phrase happens to be a palindrome, outputs this phraseunder the reverse string: "That is a palindrome. Cool!"

TODO:

- Compare the array values
- Log found palindromes to the console
- Decide on UI representation of palindrome discovery to client
- Styling
